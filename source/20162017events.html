								<h3>Date: 28th October, 2017</h3>
								<p>The event is focused at solving real life problems,
						in order to support those newly blooming and suppressed fields of science and engineering. The
						participants will be required to solve a real world problem, concerning scientific-cum-social issues,
						in a cost effective way, with an amalgamation of various fields of science and engineering (like biotechnology,
						medical electronics, agriculture, textile, etc.). The target is to describe the importance of
						these fields using working simulations and models, as well as giving a solution to the problem.</p>
